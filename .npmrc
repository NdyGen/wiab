# NPM Configuration for WIAB

# Audit Level Configuration
# We set audit-level to high to suppress low/moderate vulnerabilities
# that are documented and accepted in SECURITY.md
#
# Rationale:
# - All current vulnerabilities (4 low, 9 moderate) are in Homey SDK dependencies
# - These cannot be fixed without breaking changes to Homey SDK v2
# - Risk is assessed as Low to Medium (see SECURITY.md)
# - Vulnerabilities are monitored and documented
#
# To see all vulnerabilities including suppressed ones:
#   npm audit --audit-level=low
#
audit-level=high

# Engine Strict - ensure Node version compatibility
engine-strict=false

# Save Exact - use exact versions in package.json
save-exact=false

# Fund - disable funding messages during install
fund=false
