# App Assets

This directory contains the main app icon.

## Required File

- **icon.svg** - Scalable vector graphic for the app icon
  - Shown in Homey app store and app overview
  - Should match the device icon theme
  - Suggested colors: Orange (#FF6600)

## Design

The app icon should represent the "Wasp in a Box" concept:
- Visual metaphor for occupancy detection
- Clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Consistent with device icons

## Placeholder

Until you create a custom icon, Homey will use a default placeholder.
