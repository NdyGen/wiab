Smart room occupancy that stays active even when you sit still.

THE PROBLEM

Lights turn off while you're reading. Heating shuts down while you work. Motion
sensors only detect movement - not actual room occupancy.

THE SOLUTION

Combine motion sensors with door contacts:
- Motion detected → Room occupied
- Sitting still for hours → Still occupied
- Door opens → Room empty

Perfect for offices, living rooms, and bedrooms where people sit, read, or sleep.

HOW TO USE

1. Add a WIAB device and select your motion sensors and door contacts during pairing
2. Add the WIAB device to your room
3. Exclude the individual PIR sensors from the room's activity calculation
4. Let WIAB determine the room's occupancy state

Result: Homey's room activity becomes more reliable - no more false "room empty"
when you're sitting still!
